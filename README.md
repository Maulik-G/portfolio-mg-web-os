# [MG Web OS](https://www.maulikgaur.me/)

**Creator:** Maulik Gaur  
**Inspired by:** Y2K OS by Candy (@themeowmews on CodÃ©dex)  

MG Web OS is a **retro webOSâ€“style portfolio website** that showcases my projects, resume, and interactive apps in a unique, nostalgic way.  
It started as inspiration from Candyâ€™s Y2K OS but has evolved into my **own responsive, feature-rich portfolio system**.

## ðŸ“š Inspiration

This project was inspired by **Y2K OS by Candy (@themeowmews)**, originally created for the CodÃ©dex Holiday Hackathon.  
While the retro aesthetic remains, I expanded it into my **personal portfolio webOS** with:  

- Mobile-first responsive design  
- Interactive apps (Paint, Snake, Notepad, etc.)  
- Resume showcase  
- Project links and portfolio integration  
- A new 2007 settings Easter egg  

---

## Cool Facts

- I built the responsive design **completely in CSS**.
- Added icons are customized based on theme. 
- Includes intentional retro-style lag for aesthetics.  
- Functions both as a **fun OS simulation** and a **personal portfolio**.
